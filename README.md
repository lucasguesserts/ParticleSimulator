# PSIN
A C++ Discrete Element Method (DEM) library.

This project resulted in my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/ruancomelli/Undergraduate-Thesis) entitled "Fundamentos do Método de Elementos Discretos (DEM) e sua Aplicação à Simulação da Dinâmica de Partículas Esféricas", which can be freely translated as "Fundaments of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and it's Application to the Simulation of Spherical Particle Dynamics".

## Discrete Element Method

The [Discrete Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method) aims to solve the [Newton-Euler equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Euler_equations) for a set of rigid bodies. The main kind of interaction between those rigid bodies is contact force. The Discrete Element Method keeps track of all particles' positions and spatial orientations, monitors collisions, evaluates contact forces and solves Newton-Euler equations in a discretized timeline.

## Characteristics

This library was designed aiming great flexibility. That means that everything is as customizable as possible.
Simulations are executed based on the Discrete Element Method.

**TODO: IMPROVE THIS SECTION**

## Warning
Currently this repository is a mess. I'm sorry for that. I intend to fix this and make this library usable. This includes checking for and removing unnecessary dependencies, improving automatic building, including a documentation, cleaning up all of those branches etc.

**TODO: SOLVE THOSE ISSUES**

## TO-DO List:
- Check for and remove unnecessary dependencies
- Fix automatic building
- Remove personal configuration files
- Include documentation
- Clean up git branches
- Improve this README

**TODO: IMPROVE THIS SECTION**
